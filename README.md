# eecs442-final-project
Final project for EECS 442.

Our project will be the image colorization of grayscale images using CNN.

Our implementation will be based on Richard Zhang's CNN model for Image Colorization [here](http://richzhang.github.io/colorization/) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08511)).
